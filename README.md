# -12V-to-5V-Buck-Converter-LTspice-Simulation
This project simulates a 12V to 5V Buck Converter using LTspice
### ✅ Objective:
Design and validate a Buck Converter with:
- Input Voltage: 12V DC
- Output Voltage: ~5V DC
- IC used: LM2596 (or Discrete NMOS based)
- Load and Filter optimized for stable output

---

### 🔍 LTspice Simulation Highlights:
- *Vout settles at ~5.1V*
- *Settling Time: ~357µs*
- Cursor-validated waveform confirms stable buck operation.

---

### 📁 Files Included:
- buck_converter_sim.asc – Schematic
- buck_converter_waveform.raw – Simulation Result
- Screenshot – Waveform showing cursor-based validation

---

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- LTspice (Analog Devices)
- Windows 10

---
### 🧠Note:
This simulation is part of a broader EV Power Electronics validation portfolio with hands-on circuit-level and waveform-level verification.
